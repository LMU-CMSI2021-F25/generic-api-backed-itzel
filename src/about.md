This a webapp that is designed to find remote jobs around the world!

You can scroll, or search by filters like job type and company name.

I used the Jobicy Remote Jobs API.

I used W3Schools for applying CSS properties and styling the webapp. I also used ChatGPT to understand how to implement async function within useEffect.
